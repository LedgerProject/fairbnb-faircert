## FairBNB.COOP Certificates
Fairbnb.coop is a platform of tourist services created with the ambition to generate, in travel destinations around the world, communities of reference identity which are bound to the principles of sustainability.
Platform tourism, thanks to the cooperative management of Fairbnb.coop, becomes a tool for economic change and the promotion of innovative policies also by local administrations in an open and constant dialogue/debate between all participants in the community.

With FairCert we are now able to certify listings before they are published, the current implementation allow our local ambassadors to sign the certificate but we are working to allow local authority to be able to co-sign our certificate. The Fairbnb.coop certificate would mainly prove for a given time the compliance with local regulation and additional policies described by Local Node
